### Beta 0.6.5.1

## Features
* Switch entities for each charging schedule allows enabling/disabling charge schedules.
* Lock entity to enable or disable the charge point.
* Provides services to:
  * Disable all charging schedules: `andersen_ev.disable_all_schedules`
  * Get detailed device information: `andersen_ev.get_device_info` (results displayed in UI)
  * Get detailed real-time device status: `andersen_ev.get_device_status` (results displayed in UI)
  * Reset RCM: `andersen_ev.reset_rcm`
* Live grid power sensors for those without smart meters.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed in your Home Assistant instance.
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS:
   - Navigate to HACS → Integrations → Menu (⋮) → Custom repositories
   - Add `https://github.com/lwsrbrts/hassio-andersen-ev` as a repository
   - Select `Integration` as the category
3. Click "Add"
4. Search for "Andersen EV" in HACS and install it
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Add the integration via the Home Assistant UI (Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration)
7. Search for "Andersen EV" and follow the configuration steps

### Manual Installation

1. Download the repository as a zip file and extract it.
2. Copy the `andersen_ev` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the integration via the Home Assistant UI by providing your Andersen user account user name and password.

## Services
The integration provides the following services:

### disable_all_schedules
Disables all charging schedules for a specified device.

Example:
```yaml
service: andersen_ev.disable_all_schedules
data:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
```

### get_device_info
Retrieves detailed information about a device and displays the results directly in the Home Assistant UI. This service uses Home Assistant's new Action API that allows returning data to the user interface.

Example:
```yaml
service: andersen_ev.get_device_info
data:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
```

### get_device_status
Retrieves detailed real-time status of a device and displays the results directly in the Home Assistant UI. This provides more comprehensive status information than what is available through the sensors.

Example:
```yaml
service: andersen_ev.get_device_status
data:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
```

## Development

### pre-commit

This repo ships a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that runs the same ruff lint and
format checks as CI (pinned to the same ruff version), so issues are caught
locally before you push. To enable it:

```bash
pip install pre-commit   # or: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

The hooks then run automatically on `git commit`. To run them across the
integration source on demand:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Future development
Frankly depends on whether or not I sell my house (with the charger).

### 0.6.2
* Another contribution from [@codeandr3w](https://github.com/codeandr3w) which adds a sensor to report the fault code of the charger.

### 0.6.1
* Fix for empty friendly name causing authentication issue on integration setup. Fixes [#6](https://github.com/lwsrbrts/hassio-andersen-ev/issues/6)

### 0.6.0
* First contribution from [@codeandr3w](https://github.com/codeandr3w) adds live grid power sensors.

### 0.5.2
* Bugfix missing model data in `lock.py`

### 0.5.1
* Add serial number to device
* Added icons to HA brands repo (and included here).

### 0.5.0
* Added switch entities to enable/disable individual charging schedules
* Improved schedule control to sync changes between Home Assistant and the mobile app
* Fixed state synchronization when toggling switches or making changes in the mobile app
* Added better error handling for API communications

### 0.4.2
* Improved model name handling by properly retrieving it from the API response
* Fixed issue with device model display in Home Assistant

### 0.4.1
* Added custom Material Design icons for all sensors
* Added service:
  * `get_device_status` - Retrieves detailed real-time device status with results displayed in UI - enables use of response variables.

### 0.4.0
* Added services:
  * `disable_all_schedules` - Disables all charging schedules for a charge point
  * `get_device_info` - Retrieves detailed device information with results displayed in UI - enables use of response variables.
